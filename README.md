## Project Overview:

For this project, I am helping Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district, analyze standardized test data. The analysis we prepare will provide insights for the School Board, showcasing trends that will help to identify patterns and inform discussions on strategic district decisions on school budgets and priorities. 


## Results: 
- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
  - Scores by school spending
  - Scores by school size
  - Scores by school type

## Summary: 

Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
